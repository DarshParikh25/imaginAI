# 🎨🧠 imaginAI — AI-Powered Text-to-Image Generator

imaginAI is a full-stack SaaS web application that lets users generate stunning AI-powered images using text prompts via the ClipDrop API. Users must be logged in and have sufficient credits to generate images from text prompts. Integrated with Razorpay for seamless credit purchases, the app ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📝 Text-to-Image generation via ClipDrop API
- 🔐 Secure user registration & login system
- 💳 Credit-based generation system (1 image = 1 credit)
- 🎁 5 free credits on signup
- 🧾 Razorpay-powered credit purchase plans
- 📱 Fully responsive UI with smooth animations

---

## 📚 How It Works

1. Users sign up and receive **5 free credits**.
2. Users enter a **descriptive but focused** prompt.
3. 1 credit is deducted and the image is generated via ClipDrop.
4. When credits run out, users must buy a plan.
5. Razorpay integration handles payment; credits are added post-success.

> ⚠️ Prompts must be clear and descriptive, but not overly complex to avoid confusing the AI.
